For the experimental portion, we applied a heuristic with a normal distribution around the center of the board.  This was able to beat our original AI heuristic no matter if it was going first or second.  It was also more successful when playing against a human user.  This was surprising to us because we thought that our algorithm was more detailed and would provide the better playing stye. The experimental heuristic probably worked better due to the fact that it was able to go deeper into the search than our iterative deepening search could go, which allowed it to make more informed moves based on the information that was available to the AI.   The time constraints allowed the experimental AI to work better since it was able to look more in depth on future plays then the original AI that was not able to look as deep in the time permitted.
